1. With and without memoization (using 2D array) both codes, give same performance.
2. Both codes compute wrong value for n = 18, & m = 18.
3. Need to do 2nd memoization using hashmaps like in freecodecamp "dynamic programming" video
4. Memoization using hashmaps took a lot of time (2 days). I learnt that unordered maps can't have pair<int,int> as key. 
   There's a separate method to do that on gfg. 
5. Javascript code using memo in freecodecamp video could compute 18*18 grid accurately becos 2^53 is the int limit here whereas
   in Cpp its 2^31. Neither ll (long long) could compute correct value for 18X18.
6. One thing is computation is faster with memoization rather than plain recursive code.
